### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Jun**](https://zijunye.ca), a software developer and designer base in Canada üìç

I currently work as a software developer at [**@Trend Micro**](https://github.com/trendmicro), where I help build product related to container security. Previously, I was at [**@RBC**](https://www.rbcroyalbank.com/mortgages/first-time-home-buyers.html) and [**@Morgan Stanley**](https://www.morganstanley.com/).

Outside of work, I'm interested in product design. I make fun coding project,run, and photography.
